# üìä COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## üìÑ Project Description
This project builds a data analysis and reporting notebook that tracks global **COVID-19** trends over time. It focuses on key metrics such as **cases**, **deaths**, **recoveries**, and **vaccinations**, using real-world datasets. The goal is to clean and explore the data, visualize patterns, and generate insights using Python data tools.

By the end, you'll produce a data-driven report with visualizations and narrative insights suitable for presentation or publishing.

## üéØ Project Objectives
- ‚úÖ Import and clean COVID-19 global data  
- ‚úÖ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)  
- ‚úÖ Compare metrics across countries/regions  
- ‚úÖ Visualize trends with charts and maps  
- ‚úÖ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Segments

### 1‚É£ Data Collection
- **Source**:  
  - [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases)  
  - [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- **Action**: Download `owid-covid-data.csv` and save to your working folder.

---

### 2‚É£ Data Loading & Exploration
**Goal**: Load the dataset and understand its structure.

**Tasks**:
- Load data with `pandas.read_csv()`
- Inspect with `df.head()`, `df.columns`, `df.isnull().sum()`

**Key Columns**:  
`date`, `location`, `total_cases`, `total_deaths`, `new_cases`, `new_deaths`, `total_vaccinations`, etc.

---

### 3‚É£ Data Cleaning
**Goal**: Prepare data for analysis.

**Tasks**:
- Filter for countries like *Kenya, USA, India*
- Convert `date` column using `pd.to_datetime()`
- Handle missing values using `fillna()` or `interpolate()`

---

### 4‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Goal**: Explore trends and descriptive stats.

**Visualizations**:
- Line charts (cases, deaths)
- Bar charts (top countries)
- Heatmaps (optional correlations)

**Key Metric**:  
Death Rate = `total_deaths / total_cases`

---

### 5‚É£ Vaccination Progress Visualization
**Goal**: Analyze vaccination rollout.

**Tasks**:
- Plot cumulative vaccinations over time
- Compare % vaccinated populations

**Tools**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

---

### 6‚É£ (Optional) Choropleth Mapping
**Goal**: Visualize data on a world map.

**Tools**:
- `plotly.express` *(easier)*
- `geopandas` *(advanced)*

**Task**: Show case or vaccination rates by country using ISO codes.

---

### 7‚É£ Insights & Reporting
**Goal**: Summarize key takeaways.

**Tasks**:
- Highlight 3‚Äì5 key findings
- Note anomalies or patterns
- Use markdown for clear explanations

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- *(Optional)*: `plotly`, `geopandas`
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code (with Jupyter extension)

---

## üìå How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install requirements (if `requirements.txt` is provided)  
3. Run the notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook covid_data_tracker.ipynb
   ```

---

## üí° Sample Insights
- Country X had the fastest vaccine rollout.
- Daily cases in Country Y peaked in Month Z.
- Vaccination trends rose steadily after March 2021 in most regions.
